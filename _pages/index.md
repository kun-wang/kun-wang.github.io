My name is **Kun Wang**. I am a Staff Researcher at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](http://quantum.baidu.com/) at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/). My research interests include quantum Shannon theory, quantum resource theory, majorization theory and its applications in quantum information theory.

Previously, I was a postdoc at the [Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering (SIQSE)] (http://siqse.sustc.edu.cn/), Southern University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Masahito Hayashi](https://mhayashi.info/).

I graduated my Ph.D. in quantum information theory from the Department of Computer and Science in Nanjing University in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Fangmin Song. During 2017, I visited the University of Technology Sydney (UTS:QSI) under the supervision of Prof. [Runyao Duan](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/runyao.duan), supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC). In 2018, I visited the Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Masahito Hayashi.
