I am a Senior Researcher at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](http://quantum.baidu.com/), Baidu Research. 
My research at Baidu Quantum focuses on characterizing, verifying, validating, 
mitigating, and correcting quantum errors inherent in quantum devices.

Previously, I was a postdoc at the Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering (SIQSE), 
Southern University of Science and Technology, where I worked with Prof. [Masahito Hayashi](https://mhayashi.info/).

I received my Ph.D. degree from Nanjing University in 2019, 
supervised by Prof. [Fangmin Song](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/58/24/c2639a153636/page.htm). 
In 2017, I visited the University of Technology Sydney, 
supervised by Prof. [Runyao Duan](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Runyao.Duan), 
supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC). 
In 2018, I visited the Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, 
supervised by Prof. [Masahito Hayashi](https://mhayashi.info/).
