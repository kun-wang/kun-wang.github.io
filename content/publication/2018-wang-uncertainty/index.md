abstract: "In a work by Berta et al. [Phys. Rev. A 90, 062127 (2014)], uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory were formulated for mutually unbiased bases using conditional collision entropy. In this paper, we generalize their results to the mutually unbiased measurements. Our primary result is an equality between the amount of uncertainty for a set of measurements and the amount of entanglement of the measured state, both of which are quantified by the conditional collision entropy. Implications of this equality relation are discussed. We further show that similar equality relations can be obtained for generalized symmetric informationally complete measurements. We also derive an interesting equality for arbitrary orthogonal basis of the space of Hermitian, traceless operators."
