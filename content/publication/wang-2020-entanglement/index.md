abstract: "In this paper we investigate the relationship between direct-sum majorization formulation of uncertainty relations and entanglement, for the case of two observables. Our primary results are entanglement detection methods based on direct-sum majorization uncertainty relations. These detectors provide a set of sufficient conditions for detecting entanglement whose number grows linearly with the dimension of the state being detected."
