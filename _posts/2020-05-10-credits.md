This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a modified version of the [Yong Yuan](http://yongyuan.name/)'s beautiful theme.

Some icons are loaded using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

List of publications is generated using [Jekyll Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar), inspired by [Mohamad Ghassany](https://www.mghassany.com/publications/).

The deployment procedure follows from [zhepeiw](http://zhepeiw.com/2018/12/23/blog1.html) and [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
