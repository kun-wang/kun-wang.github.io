Subsequently, the local unitary operators are implemented on each platform, resulting in the generation of probability distributions of measurement outcomes. The max process fidelity is estimated from the probability distributions, which ultimately quantifies the relative performance of the quantum processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be adapted for quantum process tomography. We apply the protocol to compare the performance of five quantum devices from IBM and the Qianshi quantum computer from Baidu via the cloud. The experimental results unveil two notable aspects: Firstly, the protocol adeptly compares the performance of the quantum processes implemented on different quantum computers. Secondly, the protocol scales, although still exponentially, much more favorably with the number of qubits, when compared to the full quantum process tomography.

But in reality, inevitable quantum noise prevents us from accessing the desired value. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically analyzing the feasibility and efficiency of extracting high-order moments from noisy states. We first show that there exists a quantum protocol capable of accomplishing this task if and only if the underlying noise channel is invertible. We then establish a method for deriving protocols that attain optimal sample complexity using quantum operations and classical post-processing only. Our protocols, in contrast to conventional ones, incur lower overheads and avoid sampling different quantum operations due to a novel technique called observable shift, making the protocols strong candidates for practical usage on current quantum devices. The proposed method also indicates the power of entangled protocols in retrieving high-order information, whereas in the existing methods, entanglement does not help. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of how quantum noise could affect high-order information extraction and provides guidance on how to tackle it.","tags":["quantum error mitigation","quantum estimation"],"title":"Retrieving non-linear features from noisy quantum states","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun WANG","Yu-Ao Chen","Xin Wang"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1688515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688515200,"objectID":"a1413c54405bbe3009e263cf17c1d08d","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/2023-wang-mitigating/","publishdate":"2023-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-wang-mitigating/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum gates and measurements on quantum hardware are inevitably subject to hardware imperfections that lead to quantum errors. Mitigating such unavoidable errors is crucial to explore the power of quantum hardware better. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that can mitigate quantum gate and measurement errors in computing quantum expectation values utilizing the truncated Neumann series. The essential idea is to cancel the effect of quantum error by approximating its inverse via linearly combining quantum errors of different orders produced by sequential applications of the quantum devices with carefully chosen coefficients. Remarkably, the estimation error decays exponentially in the truncated order, and the incurred error mitigation overhead is independent of the system size, as long as the noise resistance of the quantum device is moderate. We numerically test this framework for different quantum errors and find that the computation accuracy is substantially improved. Our framework possesses several vital advantages: it mitigates quantum gate and measurement errors in a unified manner, it neither assumes any error structure nor requires the tomography procedure to completely characterize the quantum errors, and most importantly, it is scalable. These advantages empower our quantum error mitigation framework to be efficient and practical and extend the ability of near-term quantum devices to deliver quantum applications.","tags":["quantum error mitigation","gate error mitigation","Neumann series"],"title":"Mitigating quantum errors via truncated Neumann series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun WANG"],"categories":null,"content":"研究所简介 百度量子计算研究所成立于 2018 年 3 月。其使命是五年内建成世界一流量子人工智能研究所，并不断将量子技术整合融入百度核心业务中。研究所聚焦 QIAN 战略计划，打造量子软硬件一体化解决方案。QIAN 分别代表着百度在量子（Quantum）、基础设施（Infrastructure）、应用（Application）和网络生态（Network）等四个方面的全新战略布局。研究所所长为段润尧教授，负责百度量子计算战略的制定与实施。本科和博士均就读于清华大学计算机系，师从应明生教授。悉尼科技大学终身教授、澳大利亚研究理事会（ARC）Future Fellow。\n2020年9月15日，在“百度世界2020”大会上段润尧发布百度量子平台全景图。2021年7月10日，在“WAIC2021世界人工智能大会”上，百度量子平台全新升级，提供从应用到真机一站式云服务。百度量子平台扮演量子时代操作系统的角色，降低普通用户学习量子软硬件专业知识的成本，使非量子专业用户也能实现量子编程、量子机器学习等相关内容。百度量子平台努力为不同领域的用户赋能，力争实现“人人皆可量子”的美好愿景。\n2021年12月28日，百度举办“Create·AI开发者大会”。在主论坛上，百度 CTO 王海峰正式发布百度量子平台2.0，这是国内首个提供从应用到量子处理器一站式服务的量子计算云平台。随后在前沿探索论坛上，段润尧详细介绍了百度量子平台2.0的各项领先技术，并围绕百度量子平台构建开放、可持续的百度量子生态，为量子计算领域的发展和繁荣作出贡献。\n2022年8月25日，在Quantum Create 2022·量子开发者大会上，百度正式发布基于百度量子平台研发的产业级超导量子计算机“乾始”，及全球首个全平台量子软硬一体化解决方案“量羲”，并对外提供了包括手机端、电脑端、云开发等在内的全平台使用方式。只需下载“量易伏”APP，用户就可以体验量子计算，量子算力“触手可及”。\n百度在国家工业信息安全发展研究中心、工信部电子知识产权中心评比的量子计算全球高价值专利及创新驱动力排名中位列国内第一，国际第三。\n工作职责 您将和研究所的王琨研究员、工程师们一起推进量子噪声处理工具集 QEP 的研发工作。该工具集旨在从软件层面处理近期量子设备中广泛存在的量子噪声。实习可选择的方向包括但不限于：\n评估近期量子设备的性能并衡量其可扩展性（关键字：Randomized Benchmarking, Quantum Estimation, Quantum Verification）；\n刻画近期量子设备的量子噪声，精确标定量子态和量子门信息（关键字：Quantum Characterization, Quantum Tomography）；\n提升量子计算机的计算结果精度，降低甚至是消除量子门和量子测量噪声，扩展量子设备的计算能力（关键字：Quantum Error Mitigation, Quantum Error Correction）。\n诚挚欢迎热爱量子计算、学习动手能力强的有志之士申请。通过本实习项目中您将收获：\n量子计算领域知识与大厂实习经验，接触最前沿量子计算研究和项目；\n得到科研、工程等方面的指导，建立良好的研发习惯，积累多学科专业知识；\n个人能力得到挖掘和提升，个人价值得到发挥和认可。\n职位要求 计算机/数学/物理或相关专业的研究生或者本科生 有面向对象编程知识基础，有项目开发经验的申请人优先 有线性代数和概率论基础，有量子计算基础的申请人优先。建议学习 Nielsen and Chuang 的《Quantum Computation and Quantum Information》，重点关注第二章、第八章和第九章。 实习信息 工作地点：深圳（百度国际大厦） 工作时间：每周不低于3天，实习期不少于3个月，欢迎长期实习 申请时间：全年接收申请，也可提前申请暑期实习 联系方式: 请将简历发送至 wangkun28 at baidu dot com 实习待遇高于平均水平，表现优秀的同学有机会转正或 PhD 申请推荐。对实习有任何疑问可通过邮件联系。邮件中请注明预期实习开始时间和实习时间跨度。\n","date":1667606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667606400,"objectID":"d8ce1764bdbfb3cb9778e2e9229853c3","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/posts/2022-11-05-quantum-intern/","publishdate":"2022-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2022-11-05-quantum-intern/","section":"posts","summary":"诚挚欢迎热爱量子计算、学习动手能力强的有志之士申请量子噪声处理实习生，和百度量子计算研究所的研究员、工程师们一起推进量子噪声处理工具集 [QEP](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qep/tutorial-overvie) 的研发工作。","tags":["实习","quantum"],"title":"量子噪声处理实习生招聘","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Kun WANG"],"categories":["research"],"content":"The research achievement has been reported in the official website of SUSTECH and SIQSE.\nDense coding is one of the earliest and most prominent quantum protocols that reveal the power of quantum entanglement in communication.

In this task, the sender Alice and the helper Fred preshare an entangled state. Alice encodes a classical message into the quantum state using a symmetric preserving encoder and sends the encoded state to Bob through a noiseless quantum channel. The receiver Bob and helper Fred are limited to performing quantum measurements satisfying certain locality restrictions to decode the classical message. We are interested in the ultimate dense coding capacity under these constraints. Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we derive both one-shot and asymptotic optimal achievable transmission rates of the dense coding task under different encoder and decoder combinations. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the transmission rate cannot be improved even when the decoder is relaxed from one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to two-way LOCC, separable measurements, and partial transpose positive measurements of the bipartite system. Second, depending on the class of allowed decoders with certain locality restrictions, we relax the class of encoding operations to superquantum encoders in the general probability theory framework and derive dense coding transmission rates under this setting. For example, when the decoder is fixed to a separable measurement, theoretically, a positive operation is allowed as an encoding operation. Remarkably, even under this superquantum relaxation, the transmission rate still cannot be lifted. This fact highlights the universal validity of our analysis on practical dense coding beyond quantum theory.","tags":["dense coding","resource theory of asymmetry","environment-assisted communication","quantum information theory"],"title":"Dense Coding with Locality Restriction on Decoders: Quantum Encoders versus Superquantum Encoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lijun Xia","Liangliang Lu","Kun WANG","Xinhe Jiang","Shining Zhu","Xiaosong Ma"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1662422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662422400,"objectID":"cd6e9adfeec2e8dc918db076e9416f34","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/2022-xia-experimental/","publishdate":"2022-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-xia-experimental/","section":"publication","summary":"High-dimensional entanglement is significant for the fundamental studies of quantum physics and offers unique advantages in various quantum information processing tasks.

VED makes use of the positive map criterion and works as follows. Firstly, it decomposes a positive map into a combination of quantum operations implementable on near-term quantum devices. It then variationally estimates the minimal eigenvalue of the final state, obtained by executing these implementable operations on the target state and averaging the output states. Deterministic and probabilistic methods are proposed to compute the average. At last, it asserts that the target state is entangled if the optimized minimal eigenvalue is negative. VLNE builds upon a linear decomposition of the transpose map into Pauli terms and the recently proposed trace distance estimation algorithm.

On the other hand, general linear maps, such as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by physically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of physically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is efficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests.

Mitigation of such unavoidable errors is crucial to better explore and extend the power of near-term quantum hardware.

The essential idea is to cancel the errors by combining various noisy expectation values generated by sequential measurements determined by terms in the truncated series. We numerically test this method and find that the computation accuracy is substantially improved. Our method possesses several advantages: it does not assume any noise structure, it does not require the calibration procedure to learn the noise matrix a prior, and most importantly, the incurred error mitigation overhead is independent of system size, as long as the noise resistance of the measurement device is moderate. All these advantages empower our method as a practical measurement error mitigation method for near-term quantum devices.","tags":["quantum error mitigation","measurement error mitigation","Neumann series"],"title":"Measurement Error Mitigation via Truncated Neumann Series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masahito Hayashi","Kun Fang","Kun WANG"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1614816e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614816e3,"objectID":"f104e1f09cdc3e0cd601295c2e87a0be","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/2021-hayashi-finite/","publishdate":"2021-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-hayashi-finite/","section":"publication","summary":"We give the first systematic study on the second order asymptotics of the operational task of coherence distillation with and without assistance.

You can find the project in GitHub. It is based on a nice Java Turing machine simulator from http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/74turing/ with necessary updates. Feel free to fork, modify it.\nThe syntax of Turing machine is totally from the book of “Introduction to Models of Computation” by professor Fangmin Song, which you can buy from Amazon.\nDescription bin: Contains the compiled .class files. The “images” sub-directory is very important as it stores the required images for the simulator. In the next update, I will try to move it out of the “bin” directory.\nfiles: Contains the program description for specific operations. Examples include:\nAdder.tur: a program for adding two non-negative integers. copyString.tur: a program for copy a string of 11…11s. In these two files, I gave a detail description of the requirements for writing a program that can be accepted by the simulator.\nsrc: Source files of the simulator.\nAll of the above three directories are required for running the simulator.\nintroduction.pptx: Actually, the Turing machine simulator is a project for the third assignment of the course Software Architecture. introduction.pptx is my presentation on the course, which introduces basic ideas of the project, and the design patterns that have been applied.\nTMSimulator.7z: The packed runnable jar, with necessary config files.\nHow to Use There are two different ways to setup the simulator.\nMethod 1: Running the jar file Download the repository. Unpack TMSimulator.7z. Click the run.bat batch file. Warnning! The files and TMSimulator.jar must be in the same directory with run.bat.\nMethod 2: Importing the project into eclipse Download the repository. Import into eclipse. Run it! Known problems Problem 1 Problem Description: When exporting the project as a runnable jar (TMSimulator.jar is exported in this way), images cannot be load, as the jar cannot find the images.\nCurrent Solution: This problem happens because the exporting system hasn’t add the necessary files in bin/images into the jar file. There are two solutions:\nModify the code to add the files. Add the images directory into the jar file manually. Due to my laziness, I take the latter one. It deserves better solution.\nProblem 2 Problem Description: The input and output have been restricted into binary values, which are required by the simulator yet are not that human friendly.\nPossible Solution: One encode module to translate the input decimal integers into corresponding bianry values, then feeding them into the simulator. One decode module to translate the output bianry value into corresponding decimal integer, then displaying out.\nMore on the Simulator If you have any ideas on the project, please feel free to let me know. You can try following ways to keep us in touch.\nComment on this post. This is highly recommended. Fork the project, and push the new version to me. Email me.

The research was published in the high-impact academic journal Physical Review Letters (PRL) under the title, “Application of the Resource Theory of Channels to Communication Scenarios”.\nQuantum resource theories offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. However, a common criticism is that the framework often ends up with a formalistic level not solving existing problems. In particular, it has been elusive whether the resource theory of quantum channels would be helpful for answering concrete problems at all.\nOn the other hand, entanglement-assisted information transmission via quantum channel has been a major field of research in quantum information theory at all times. Its central goal is to understand how much of the resources are required to accomplish the desired information transmission by utilizing quantum entanglement.\nQuantum entanglement is known as a resource of magical power of quantum system. The aim clarifies how entanglement enhances information transmission, while analyzing this improvement is notoriously difficult due to their complex structures. This motivates the question of whether we can adopt the quantum resource theory framework to investigate the improvement of information transmission by using entanglement, consolidating it as effective tools to solve concrete problems.\nMasahito Hayashi and his collaborators took the first step in this direction. They introduced the resource theory of communication, a resource theory of channels relevant to communication via quantum channels. With this formalism, they successfully characterized fundamental properties of a quantum channel as a communication mean: how much information the channel can reliably send (channel capacity) under the efficient use of entanglement and how hard it is to effectively implement the channel (channel simulation cost).\nThe introduced framework allowed them to employ several novel ideas and techniques that have recently been developed in the study of resource theories to address the “classic” problems in quantum information theory. In particular, they extended the results on the operational characterization of resource theories and obtained an important property known as the strong converse property, which shows the ultimate limitation of the amount of information transmission under the efficient use of entanglement, as well as characterized its channel simulation cost by formulating it as a resource transformation task in the proposed resource theory.\nThey further showed that their resource theory has an intimate connection to the communication with help of ultimate correlation allowed by causal theories respecting the theory of relativity, suggesting that their framework may serve as an effective theoretical platform to investigate fundamental limitation of communication over quantum channels.\nThis research shed new perspective to fundamental problems in quantum Shannon theory while lifting the resource theory of channels to effective tools in addressing concrete problems. The technique formalized is extendable to more generic settings thanks to the systematic nature of the resource theory framework.\nRyuji Takagi, a Ph.D. student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was the first author of the paper.

We show that the behavior of Grover walks on a line with absorbing boundaries is strikingly different from that of classical walks and that of Hadamard walks.","tags":["quantum walks","grover walk with absorbing boundaries","absorbing probabilities"],"title":"Grover walks on a line with absorbing boundaries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 🎉 2024.01—Our work Cross-Platform Comparison of Arbitrary Quantum Processes (with Congcong Zheng and Xutao Yu) was published in npj Quantum Information!\n📰 2023.12—Our work Fidelity Estimation of Entangled Measurements with Local States (with Zanqiu Shen) was submitted to arXiv.\n📰 2023.12—Our work Memory Effects in Quantum State Verification (with Siyuan Chen and Wei Xie) was submitted to arXiv.\n📰 2023.09—Our work Retrieving non-linear features from noisy quantum states (with Benchi Zhao, Mingrui Jing, Lei Zhang, Xuanqiang Zhao, and Xin Wang) was submitted to arXiv.\n🎉 2023.07—Our work Mitigating quantum errors via truncated Neumann series (with Yu-Ao Chen and Xin Wang) was published in Science China Information Sciences!\n📰 2023.03—Our work Cross-Platform Comparison of Arbitrary Quantum Processes (with Congcong Zheng and Xutao Yu) was submitted to arXiv.\n🎉 2022.09—Our work Dense Coding with Locality Restriction on Decoders: Quantum Encoders versus Superquantum Encoders (with Masahito Hayashi) was published in PRX Quantum!\n🎉 2022.09—Our work Experimental optimal verification of three-dimensional entanglement on a silicon chip (with Lijun Xia, Liangliang Lu, Xinhe Jiang, Shining Zhu, and Xiaosong Ma) was published in New Journal of Physics!\n📰 2022.06—Our work Detecting and Eliminating Quantum Noise of Quantum Measurements (with Shuanghong Tang and Congcong Zheng) was submitted to arXiv.\n🎉 2022.05—Our work Detecting and quantifying entanglement on near-term quantum devices (with Zhixin Song, Xuanqiang Zhao, Zihe Wang, and Xin Wang) was published in npj Quantum Information!\n🎉 2021.12—Our work Physical Implementability of Linear Maps and Its Application in Error Mitigation (with Jiaqing Jiang and Xin Wang) was published in Quantum!\n📰 2021.11—Our work Mitigating quantum errors via truncated Neumann series (with Yu-Ao Chen and Xin Wang) was submitted to arXiv.\n🎉 2021.05—Our work Measurement Error Mitigation via Truncated Neumann Series (with Yu-Ao Chen and Xin Wang) was accepted as a talk in TQC 2021 arXiv!\n🎉 2021.03—Our work Finite Block Length Analysis on Quantum Coherence Distillation and Incoherent Randomness Extraction (with Masahito Hayashi and Kun Fang) was published in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory!(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9370124).\n🎉 2021.02—Our work Permutation Enhances Classical Communication Assisted by Entangled States (with Masahito Hayashi) was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory!\n🎉 2020.10—Our work Towards the standardization of quantum state verification using optimal strategies (with Xinhe Jiang, Kaiyi Qian, Zhaozhong Chen, Zhiyu Chen, Liangliang Lu, Lijun Xia, Fangmin Song, Shining Zhu, and Xiaosong!Ma) was published in npj Quantum Information.\n🎉 2020.04—Our work Quantification of Unextendible Entanglement and Its Applications in Entanglement Distillation (with Xin Wang and Mark Wilde) was accepted as a talk in 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT!2020).\n🎉 2020.03—Our work Application of the Resource Theory of Channels to Communication Scenarios (with Ryuji Takagi and Masahito Hayashi) was published in Physical Review Letters!\n🎉 2020.03—Our work Permutation Enhances Classical Communication Assisted by Entangled States (with Masahito Hayashi) was accepted as a talk in 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2020)!\n🎉 2019.09—Our work Optimal verification of two-qubit pure states (with Masahito Hayashi) was published in Physical Review A!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9db37fa3ba3c13e915c7388156e938a0","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/_news/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/_news/","section":"","summary":"🎉 2024.01—Our work Cross-Platform Comparison of Arbitrary Quantum Processes (with Congcong Zheng and Xutao Yu) was published in npj Quantum Information!\n📰 2023.12—Our work Fidelity Estimation of Entangled Measurements with Local States (with Zanqiu Shen) was submitted to arXiv.","tags":null,"title":"News","type":"page"}]
