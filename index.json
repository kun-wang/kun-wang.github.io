Although it has been intensively studied, it has typically been restricted to scenarios where the receiver can perform global measurements to decode information, which is experimentally challenging. Thus, it is natural to impose locality conditions on the decoders from a practical perspective.\nIn this work, we explore the practicality of dense coding by elaborating 21 classes of dense coding capacities with different encoder-decoder pairs, where the encoders are constrained by the resource theory of asymmetry and the decoders are constrained by various locality conditions. Our contributions are to 1) show that all these capacities are equal and derive a single-letter capacity formula; 2) prove that all these capacities satisfy the desirable strong converse property; and 3) establish an equivalence among three different quantities of a bipartite quantum state—the operationally defined dense coding capacity, the mathematically defined regularized asymmetry of assistance, and the quantum entropy of the twirled quantum state—thus providing the regularized asymmetry of the assistance measure an operational meaning.\nOur results significantly push forward the research of practical dense coding in both the one-shot and asymptotic regimes within different resource theories.

In this task, the sender Alice and the helper Fred preshare an entangled state. Alice encodes a classical message into the quantum state using a symmetric preserving encoder and sends the encoded state to Bob through a noiseless quantum channel. The receiver Bob and helper Fred are limited to performing quantum measurements satisfying certain locality restrictions to decode the classical message. We are interested in the ultimate dense coding capacity under these constraints. Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we derive both one-shot and asymptotic optimal achievable transmission rates of the dense coding task under different encoder and decoder combinations. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the transmission rate cannot be improved even when the decoder is relaxed from one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to two-way LOCC, separable measurements, and partial transpose positive measurements of the bipartite system. Second, depending on the class of allowed decoders with certain locality restrictions, we relax the class of encoding operations to superquantum encoders in the general probability theory framework and derive dense coding transmission rates under this setting. For example, when the decoder is fixed to a separable measurement, theoretically, a positive operation is allowed as an encoding operation. Remarkably, even under this superquantum relaxation, the transmission rate still cannot be lifted. This fact highlights the universal validity of our analysis on practical dense coding beyond quantum theory.","tags":["dense coding","resource theory of asymmetry","environment-assisted communication","quantum information theory"],"title":"Dense Coding with Locality Restriction on Decoders: Quantum Encoders versus Superquantum Encoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lijun Xia","Liangliang Lu","Kun WANG","Xinhe Jiang","Shining Zhu","Xiaosong Ma"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1662422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662422400,"objectID":"4bdab2b3897ab2f3076aa7853eef381b","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/xia-2022-experimental/","publishdate":"2022-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xia-2022-experimental/","section":"publication","summary":"High-dimensional entanglement is significant for the fundamental studies of quantum physics and offers unique advantages in various quantum information processing tasks.

This paper combines hybrid quantum-classical computation and quasi-probability decomposition to propose two variational quantum algorithms, called variational entanglement detection (VED) and variational logarithmic negativity estimation (VLNE), for detecting and quantifying entanglement on near-term quantum devices, respectively. VED makes use of the positive map criterion and works as follows. Firstly, it decomposes a positive map into a combination of quantum operations implementable on near-term quantum devices. It then variationally estimates the minimal eigenvalue of the final state, obtained by executing these implementable operations on the target state and averaging the output states. Deterministic and probabilistic methods are proposed to compute the average. At last, it asserts that the target state is entangled if the optimized minimal eigenvalue is negative. VLNE builds upon a linear decomposition of the transpose map into Pauli terms and the recently proposed trace distance estimation algorithm. It variationally estimates the well-known logarithmic negativity entanglement measure and could be applied to quantify entanglement on near-term quantum devices. Experimental and numerical results on the Bell state, isotropic states, and Breuer states show the validity of the proposed entanglement detection and quantification methods.","tags":["quantum entanglement detection","noisy intermediate-scale quantum","positive map criterion"],"title":"Detecting and quantifying entanglement on near-term quantum devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiaqing Jiang","Kun WANG","Xin Wang"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1638835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638835200,"objectID":"f2c8e1e769fb515cf2f455f545d24cad","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/jiang-2021-physical/","publishdate":"2021-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-2021-physical/","section":"publication","summary":"Completely positive and trace-preserving maps characterize physically implementable quantum operations. On the other hand, general linear maps, such as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by physically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of physically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is efficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests. Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. In particular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation has no advantage over local error mitigation.

Given a bipartite state ρ AB , the key idea behind these measures is to minimize a divergence between ρ AB and any possibly reduced state ρ AB ' of an extension ρ ABB ' of ρ AB . These measures are intuitively motivated by the fact that the more a bipartite state is entangled, the less each of its individual systems can be entangled with a third party.

In these two files, I gave a detail description of the requirements for writing a program that can be accepted by the simulator.\nsrc: Source files of the simulator.\nAll of the above three directories are required for running the simulator.\nintroduction.pptx: Actually, the Turing machine simulator is a project for the third assignment of the course Software Architecture. introduction.pptx is my presentation on the course, which introduces basic ideas of the project, and the design patterns that have been applied.\nTMSimulator.7z: The packed runnable jar, with necessary config files.\nHow to Use There are two different ways to setup the simulator.\nMethod 1: Running the jar file Download the repository. Unpack TMSimulator.7z. Click the run.bat batch file. Warnning! The files and TMSimulator.jar must be in the same directory with run.bat.\nMethod 2: Importing the project into eclipse Download the repository. Import into eclipse. Run it! Known problems Problem 1 Problem Description: When exporting the project as a runnable jar (TMSimulator.jar is exported in this way), images cannot be load, as the jar cannot find the images.\nCurrent Solution: This problem happens because the exporting system hasn’t add the necessary files in bin/images into the jar file. There are two solutions:\nModify the code to add the files. Add the images directory into the jar file manually. Due to my laziness, I take the latter one. It deserves better solution.\nProblem 2 Problem Description: The input and output have been restricted into binary values, which are required by the simulator yet are not that human friendly.\nPossible Solution: One encode module to translate the input decimal integers into corresponding bianry values, then feeding them into the simulator. One decode module to translate the output bianry value into corresponding decimal integer, then displaying out.\nMore on the Simulator If you have any ideas on the project, please feel free to let me know. You can try following ways to keep us in touch.\nComment on this post. This is highly recommended. Fork the project, and push the new version to me. Email me.

We find that our theory with such a simple structure is useful to address central problems in quantum Shannon theory—in particular, we provide a converse bound for the one-shot nonsignaling assisted classical capacity that naturally leads to its strong converse property, as well as obtain the one-shot channel simulation cost with nonsignaling assistance. We clarify an intimate connection between the nonsignaling assistance and our formalism by identifying the nonsignaling assisted channel coding with the channel transformation under the maximal set of resource nongenerating superchannels, providing a physical characterization of the latter. Our results provide new perspectives and concise arguments to those problems, connecting the recently developed fields of resource theories to “classic” settings in quantum information theory and shedding light on the validity of resource theories of channels as effective tools to address practical problems.","tags":["resource theory of quantum channels","nonsignaling assisted classical capacity","quantum Shannon theory"],"title":"Application of the resource theory of channels to communication scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun WANG","Nan Wu","Fangmin Song"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1579132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579132800,"objectID":"c051f4bd6e91bc29bf474c53c2871b0a","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/wang-2020-entanglement/","publishdate":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2020-entanglement/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we investigate the relationship between direct-sum majorization formulation of uncertainty relations and entanglement, for the case of two observables.

Unlike conventional ways of expressing entanglement monogamy via entanglement measure inequalities, we introduce a state-dependent set of free states to quantify the unextendibility of a bipartite quantum state. First, we define a family of entanglement measures called unextendible entanglement. Given a bipartite state ρAB, the key idea behind these measures is to minimize a divergence between ρAB and any possible reduced state ρAB′ of an extension ρABB′ of ρAB. These measures are intuitively motivated by the fact that the more that a bipartite state is entangled, the less that each of its individual systems can be entangled with a third party. Second, we show that the unextendible entanglement is an entanglement monotone under two-extendible operations, which include local operations and one-way classical communication as a special case. Unextendible entanglement has several other desirable properties, including normalization and faithfulness. As practical applications, we show that the unextendible entanglement provides efficiently computable benchmarks for the rate of exact secret key distillation and entanglement distillation and the overhead of probabilistic secret key or entanglement distillation.","tags":["quantum entanglement","extendibility of quantum entanglement","entanglement measure"],"title":"Quantifying the unextendibility of entanglement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun WANG","Masahito Hayashi"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":1568073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568073600,"objectID":"71a82672a4329994c29f9632fb9fa680","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/wang-2019-optimal/","publishdate":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2019-optimal/","section":"publication","summary":"In a recent work [Pallister, Linden, and Montanaro, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 170502 (2018)], Pallister et al. proposed an optimal strategy to verify nonmaximally entangled two-qubit pure states under the constraint that the accessible measurements are locally projective and nonadaptive. Their good result leads naturally to the following question: What is the optimal strategy among general local operations and classical communication (LOCC) measurements? In this paper, we answer this problem completely for two-qubit pure states. To be specific, we give the optimal strategy for each of the following available classes of measurements: (i) local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC) measurements; (ii) local operations and two-way classical communication (two-way LOCC) measurements; and (iii) separable measurements. Surprisingly, our results reveal that for the two-qubit pure state verification problem two-way LOCC measurements remarkably outperform one-way LOCC measurements and have the same power as the separable measurements.","tags":["quantum state verification","local measurement","LOCC measurement","separable measurement"],"title":"Optimal verification of two-qubit pure states","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun WANG","Nan Wu","Fangmin Song"],"categories":["research"],"content":"","date":153792e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":153792e4,"objectID":"205960c3a89c9270950b9aa369d5ffea","permalink":"https://kunwang.info/publication/wang-2018-uncertainty/","publishdate":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2018-uncertainty/","section":"publication","summary":"In a work by Berta et al.

Our primary result is an equality between the amount of uncertainty for a set of measurements and the amount of entanglement of the measured state, both of which are quantified by the conditional collision entropy. Implications of this equality relation are discussed. We further show that similar equality relations can be obtained for generalized symmetric informationally complete measurements.
